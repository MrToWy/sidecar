      <description>This approach uses burnt sugar syrup instead of granulated sugar, so I take pains to warm it and the whiskey before mixing with the coffee to avoid a lukewarm drink.
Technically, any Irish whiskey will work, but you really ought to use Tullamore Dew.
 1 oz Irish whiskey¾ oz burnt sugar syrup3½ oz extra strong fresh-brewed coffee1 oz cream, whipped until thick and frothy but still pourable Brew your coffee with the normal amount of grounds but half the normal amount of water so it is extra strong.</description>

      <description>Some people will argue an Old Fashioned must be made with a sugar cube. Those people haven’t tried it with burnt sugar syrup. 2 oz rye whiskey¾ oz burnt sugar syrup2 dashes Angostura bitters2 dashes orange bittersorange twist Add ice to a rocks glass. Add both bitters, then the whiskey and burnt sugar syrup. The syrup will sink to the bottom, so give it a quick stir to mix.</description>
