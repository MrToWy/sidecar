      <description>This approach uses burnt sugar syrup instead of granulated sugar, so I take pains to warm it and the whiskey before mixing with the coffee to avoid a lukewarm drink.
Technically, any Irish whiskey will work, but you really ought to use Tullamore Dew.
 1 oz Irish whiskey¾ oz burnt sugar syrup3½ oz extra strong fresh-brewed coffee1 oz cream, whipped until thick and frothy but still pourable Brew your coffee with the normal amount of grounds but half the normal amount of water so it is extra strong.</description>
