I enjoy making cocktails, but I’m not a fan of cocktail recipe books. I own one with 1,200 recipes. Half of them are terrible and others&mdash;well, let’s just say I don’t want four recipes for a particular drink. I want *the* recipe for it.

Sidecar is different. These are only recipes that I have personally tested and enjoyed. Some of these are exactly as I found them. Others I have tinkered with. And a few I have [created myself](/tags/sidecar-original).

## About the Recipes

This is first and foremost *my* collection of cocktails. Some are very traditional. Some deviate wildly from tradition. I figure I might as well put it out here for anyone else who might enjoy it as well. Hopefully you’ll enjoy them as well.

If you’re new to cocktails, be sure you are familiar with the three techniques for making drinks: [shaken](/techniques/shake/), [stirred](/techniques/stir/), and [built](/techniques/build/). I’ll also be adding entries for other important mixology skills.
