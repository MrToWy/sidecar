{{< summary >}}
The Negroni is my favorite drink. It’s quite sweet, but also bitter and complex. I make mine with Tanquery gin and Cocchi di Torino vermouth. It can also be served on the rocks, but I prefer it neat.

This drink is a great test of your [stirring](/techniques/stirring/) skills. It really falls flat if you don’t stir it properly.
