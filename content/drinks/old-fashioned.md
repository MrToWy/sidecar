{{< summary >}}
Some people will argue an Old Fashioned must be made with a sugar cube. Those people haven’t tried it with [burnt sugar syrup](/ingredients/burnt-sugar-syrup). A half ounce may seem like a lot of syrup, but burnt sugar isn’t quite as sweet as normal simple syrup, so I find this amount provides a good balance.

{{< ingredients
  "2 oz rye whiskey"
  "½ oz burnt sugar syrup"
  "2 dashes Angostura bitters"
  "2 dashes orange bitters"
  "orange twist"
>}}


{{< instructions >}}
Add ice to a rocks glass. Add both bitters, then the whiskey and burnt sugar syrup. The syrup will sink to the bottom, so give it a quick stir to mix.

Cut a think slice of orange peel. Express the oils over the drink, then rub it around the rim of the glass and place it in the drink.
