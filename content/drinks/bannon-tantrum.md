“The media should keep its mouth shut and just listen for awhile”&mdash;Steve Bannon throwing a tantrum on Jan 26, 2017

This must be made with [Dry Fly brand vodka](http://www.dryflydistilling.com/dryfly-product/washington-wheat-vodka/); It has an amazing wheat flavor and I created this recipe specifically to let it shine.
