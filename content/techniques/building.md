There are three techniques for making a cocktail: building, [shaking](/techniques/shaking), and [stirring](/techniques/stirring). Itâ€™s important to know when to use which method.

*Building* a cocktail is the easiest method. Start by adding ice to the serving glass (if needed), then measure the ingredients one-by-one and pour them over the ice. Sometimes a quick stir is needed to incorate the ingredients together. Finally, top with the garnish, if the drink has one.

Highball drinks are built, such as Jack & Coke, Seven &amp; Seven, and [Gin &amp; Tonic](/drinks/gin-and-tonic/). A handful of other cocktails are typically built as well, including the [Old Fashioned](/drinks/old-fashioned/).
